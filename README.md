This is a react app made to inform users about the St. Johns River, Florida's longest River.
This app includes 7 screens, where a user can learn things such as fun facts about the river and history. To keep the user engaged I have added a counter which I have previously used to count the number of manatees seen on each of the individual pages. The user named, "Explorer" is welcomed as soon as the app is brought up. Visual aids are added to all the pages to show the beautiful nature this state has to offer. Users can navigate through the pages from the home page or once on a page, be taken to the next by clicking the "suggested next page" button.

* Mobile Development Main Repository

This is the main "Readme" file for this repository.

Readme files contain useful information for software developers, and sometimes for advanced users. 

They can describe the steps necessary to install, deploy, or otherwise build software. Many repositories contain build scripts or "package.json" files.

In this repository, you will complete the exercises.
